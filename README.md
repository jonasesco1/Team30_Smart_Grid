# Team30 Smart Grid

## The Team

The creators of this project are:

| Name  | Email |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Jonas Escobar  | jesco@bu.edu  |
| Aidan McCall  | apm22@bu.edu  |

## The Client

The client of this project is Professor Alan Pisano (apisano@bu.edu). 

## The Purpose

The purpose of this project is to design a test facility that can be used by a professor to teach students about how an electrical grid works including generation, transmission, distribution, phasors, and loads. 

## How to use

This repository is meant to help inform a professor, student, or future design team how the test facility works and operates. Please note that there were two groups that worked on this project: Labeled as 2015 Team and 2022 Team. The 2015 Team did a majority of the design on the grid model, and the 2022 Team designed the data acquisition system. Most of the 2015 Team's work carried for over into into the 2022 Team. However, in the event of any differences, default to the 2022 Team. 

Both folders are set up the same way including software documentation, hardware documentation, pictures, and all reports completed throughout the semester. The 2022 hardware documentation and software documentation Readme's and 2022 User's Manual will be the most helpful in operating the test facility. 

### Hardware

Hardware can be split up into two different categories: data acquisition unit hardware and test facility hardware. The DAQ information is found in the 2022 Hardware documentation folder and includes information about the sensor boards, myDAQ, and PicoScope. The test facility hardware is found in the 2015 Hardware documentation folder and includes information about the generators, synchronization method, and transmission line boards. 

### Software

Most of the software documentation is found in the 2022 Software Documentation folder including all MATLAB code for the myDAQ and information on the PicoScope. Code for the MSP430 feedback boards is found in the 2015 Software Documentation folder.

### Reports

All reports for all teams are found the respective folders. The most important report is the User's Manual although the other reports highlight the engineering process each team went through. A user only needs to read the 2022 User's Manual in order to understand and operate the test facility. However, the 2015 User's Manual has good supplemental information in case of modifications or confusion.
