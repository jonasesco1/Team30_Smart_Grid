This repository is meant to help inform a professor, student, or future design team how our electric grid model works and operates. Please note that there were two groups that worked on this project: Labeled as 2015 Team and 2022 Team. The 2015 Team did a majority of the design on the grid model, and the 2022 Team designed the data acquisition system. Most of the 2015 Team's work carried for over into into the 2022 Team. However, in the event of any differences, default to the 2022 Team. 

Both folders are set up the same way including software documentation of their projects, hardware documentation of their project, pictures, and all reports completed throughout the semester.
