## The Client

## The Purpose

The purpose of this project is to design a test facility that can be used by a professor to teach students about how an electrical grid works including generation, transmission, distribution, phasors, and loads. 

## How to use

This repository is meant to help inform a professor, student, or future design team how the test facility works and operates. Please note that there were two groups that worked on this project: Labeled as 2015 Team and 2022 Team. The 2015 Team did a majority of the design on the grid model, and the 2022 Team designed the data acquisition system. Most of the 2015 Team's work carried for over into into the 2022 Team. However, in the event of any differences, default to the 2022 Team. 

Both folders are set up the same way including software documentation, hardware documentation, pictures, and all reports completed throughout the semester. The 2022 hardware and software Readme's and 2022 User's Manual will be the most helpful in operating the test facility.
